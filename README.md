# import

This is import's README.

This project enables you to quickly create a new project.That has stopped updating and is based on the wxPython package.

## Background

~~The author always has some strange ideas.~~ The author wanted to make a program to quickly build a project, so the author made this project called import.

Previously, the author planned to let you directly modify the code to change the default path.

But then think about it, it seems a little inconvenient.

Therefore, **SQLite3 package** + **SQL command** + **database** are used to store / modify the default path.

The **Change config.py** file is then created.

You can now directly modify the default path using the **Change config.py** program.

## Install

This project can be run directly,but this project needs to install some necessary modules.

You can use this code in the project save location:pip install -r wxPython

Then open Python and run it.

## Usage

At present, the following functions have been realized:

- Make
- Cut
- Copy
- Rename
- Delete
- Install sign
- Uninstall sign
- Change config

This project can be run directly,The author will make an app version later.

This project needs to install some necessary modules.

The code is on it.

## Maintainers
